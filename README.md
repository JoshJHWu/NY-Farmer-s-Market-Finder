# NY-Farmer-s-Market-Finder

This app will find farmer's markets in your zip code using data from https://nycopendata.socrata.com.

We are students in NYC Dev Bootcamp. A few weeks ago, we had little to no experience with web development. We created this app in a 3 hours hackathon to showcase the skills we have acquired in 3 weeks.
